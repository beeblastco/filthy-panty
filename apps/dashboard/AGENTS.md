# Next.js: ALWAYS read docs before coding

Before any Next.js work, find and read the relevant doc in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/`. Your training data is outdated — the docs are the source of truth.

## Monorepo context

This app is `apps/dashboard` in the filthy-panty Bun-workspaces monorepo. If you started directly in this folder, also read `../../AGENTS.md` for the monorepo-wide rules.

The Convex backend lives at `../../packages/convex` (`@filthy-panty/convex`) and is imported here as `@filthy-panty/convex/...` (for example `@filthy-panty/convex/_generated/api`), never via a local `convex/` directory.

Before changing any Convex backend file under `../../packages/convex`, read `../../packages/convex/AGENTS.md`. That file owns Convex schema, function, auth, codegen, and backend style rules.

## Commands

- Package manager: `bun` (not npm/yarn)
- Format/lint: `bun run format`, do not run `tsc` raw or `bunx tsc --noEmit 2>&1`.

## Key Conventions

- Use `key: value` format when passing parameters (no shorthand)
- Next.js uses `proxy.ts` instead of `middleware.ts` ([docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/proxy))

## Authentication

WorkOS AuthKit handles SSO with Google OAuth. Dashboard-owned auth code lives in:

- `proxy.ts` — Next.js session middleware
- `app/auth/` — sign-in/callback routes using `@workos-inc/authkit-nextjs`

Convex user sync, JWT config, and authenticated Convex functions are backend concerns. Read `../../packages/convex/AGENTS.md` before changing them.

- Ignore or skip `components/ui/` (Shadcn components)
- React components: one-line description of what it displays
- Update docstrings when modifying functions
- Component files use CamelCase naming

Do not create new function unless it is completely different from and cannot reusable code in any way. Try to figure it out a way to write less code but still maintainable. Remember the larger the code base and more complex -> the more technical debt.

- Each return clause have to seperate 1 line before the return statement.

UI/UX cursor rules — every interactive element must have an explicit cursor class:

- Clickable buttons, links, triggers → `cursor-pointer`
- Disabled elements → `cursor-not-allowed`
- Plain `<button>` and `<a>` elements default to `cursor-default` in some resets, so always set it explicitly.
- Apply this to all custom components and any shadcn/ui component overrides in `components/ui/`.
