# Architecture and Workflows

The deployed system is a multi-account serverless agent harness. Accounts are managed by `account-manage`; runtime traffic is handled by `harness-processing`.

## Monorepo Layout

The repository is a Bun-workspaces monorepo. The core SST app is self-contained under `apps/core/` so it can later be swapped for a Rust/cloud-native runtime without touching the other workspaces.

```mermaid

  Dash -->|"deploys + imports _generated API"| Cvx
  Core -->|"STORAGE_PROVIDER=convex<br/>ConvexHttpClient"| Cvx
  Demos -->|"imports"| Sdk
  Sdk -->|"HTTP to deployed Function URLs"| Core
```

All file paths below are relative to `apps/core/`.

## Runtime Layer

Both Lambdas use the Bun custom runtime and `startStreamingRuntime()` from `functions/_shared/runtime.ts`.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  Aws["AWS Lambda service"] -->|"provided.al2023"| Bun["Bun custom runtime binary"]
  Bun --> Boot["functions/*/bootstrap.ts"]
  Boot --> Runtime["startStreamingRuntime(handler)"]
  Runtime --> Handler["handler(event)"]
  Handler --> Response["LambdaResponse<br/>status, headers, body, afterResponse"]
  Response --> Runtime
```

Runtime boundary:

- SST points Lambda `handler` to `bootstrap`.
- The runtime passes the full Function URL event envelope into each handler.
- `afterResponse` lets channel webhooks acknowledge quickly, then continue work after the HTTP response.

## Account Routing

Every runtime request resolves an account and an account-owned agent before agent work begins.

The diagrams show the logical ownership of runtime config. In code, `integrations.ts` resolves the account once, loads the selected agent, then passes the runtime config into `handler.ts` and `session.ts` to avoid extra lookups during the turn. The runtime projection keeps model, tool, workspace, and skills config, but strips channel credentials before the agent loop.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  Direct["POST / or /async"] --> Bearer["Authorization: Bearer account secret"]
  Status["GET /status/\{eventId\}"] --> Bearer
  Bearer --> Hash["hash secret"]
  Hash --> Lookup["AccountConfig GSI<br/>SecretHashIndex"]
  Lookup --> Account["active AccountRecord"]

  Webhook["POST /webhooks/\{accountId\}/\{agentId\}/\{channel\}"] --> Load["load account by accountId"]
  Load --> AgentLookup["load agent by agentId"]
  AgentLookup --> ChannelConfig["read encrypted agent config<br/>channels.\{channel\}"]
  ChannelConfig --> Verify["verify provider-native signature/secret"]
  Verify --> Account

  Account --> Namespace["prefix event/conversation keys<br/>acct:\{accountId\}:..."]
```

A third auth path exists for trusted platform services: when `SERVICE_AUTH_SECRET` is configured, a request bearing that secret plus an `X-Account-Id` header acts on behalf of that account without knowing its account secret. It is used by the dashboard backend for server-side calls.

Root provider webhooks are not accepted. Provider webhook URLs must include the `accountId`, `agentId`, and channel name.

## Account Management

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant U as Account owner
  participant M as account-manage
  participant A as AccountConfig table
  participant S as Skills S3 bucket

  U->>M: POST /accounts { username, description? }
  M->>M: generate accountId + secret
  M->>A: store secretHash + metadata
  M-->>U: account + one-time secret

  U->>M: POST /accounts/me/agents (Bearer account secret)
  M->>A: store encrypted agent config
  M-->>U: agent + agentId

  U->>M: POST /accounts/me/skills (Bearer account secret)
  M->>S: validate + store skill bundle
  M-->>U: path

  U->>M: PATCH /accounts/me/agents/{agentId}
  M->>A: resolve secretHash
  M->>A: deep-merge agent metadata/config
  M-->>U: redacted agent view
```

Provider secrets are not returned in normal account responses. Secret-like fields are redacted as `********`; sending that value back in a patch preserves the existing stored secret.

Deleting an account runs account-scoped cleanup before removing the account record. The cleanup deletes runtime rows whose keys are prefixed with `acct:{accountId}:` and removes the current account filesystem namespaces from S3.

## Direct and Async API

  Async --> Auth
  Auth --> Parse["parse direct payload"]

  AgentLookup --> Session["session.ts<br/>claim + context + skills"]
  Session --> HandlerLoop["handler.ts<br/>parent continuation loop"]
  HandlerLoop --> Coordinator["SubagentCoordinator<br/>created per request"]
  HandlerLoop --> ToolCoordinator["AsyncToolCoordinator<br/>created per request"]

  Async --> Pending["async-agent-result.ts<br/>processing"]
  Pending --> AsyncTable["AsyncAgentResult"]
  Async --> SelfInvoke["Lambda async self-invocation"]
  SelfInvoke --> Session
  Agent --> Complete["async-agent-result.ts<br/>completed / failed"]
  Complete --> AsyncTable

  Caller -->|"GET /status/\{eventId\}"| Status["status poll"]
  Status --> Auth
  Status --> AsyncTable
```

The async path starts inside `harness-processing`: `POST /async` creates `AsyncAgentResult`, returns a status URL, and starts an internal Lambda Event invocation. Subagents and built-in async tools run inside that Lambda. Uploaded custom tools always execute in Kubernetes; uploaded async tools are waited on for SSE, but `/async`, channel, and NATS turns launch them as detached sandbox work that completes through `/sandbox-jobs/{resultId}/complete`.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  Parent["parent model pass"] --> Kind{"child work type"}
  Kind -->|"subagent"| InMemory["in-memory pending work"]
  Kind -->|"built-in async tool"| InMemory
  Kind -->|"uploaded async tool on SSE"| InMemory
  Kind -->|"uploaded async tool on detached path"| External["Kubernetes background runner"]
  InMemory -->|"wait only while pendingCount > 0"| Inject["inject result into conversation"]
  External -->|"sandbox-jobs complete endpoint"| Group["sealed detached group<br/>all siblings settled"]
  Group --> Inject
  Inject --> Continue["continue parent agent"]
```

Direct sync and async POST access is controlled by `ENABLE_DIRECT_API`. Deploys inject it explicitly and default it to `false` — set `ENABLE_DIRECT_API=true` to open `POST /` and `POST /async`. When disabled, channel webhooks and internal worker invocations remain available. Account-authenticated async tool completions arrive at `POST /async-tools/{resultId}/complete`; sandbox jobs use the token-authenticated `POST /sandbox-jobs/{resultId}/complete` instead.

## Cron Jobs

Cron jobs are included in the default stack as a small scheduled-agent add-on, not a workflow DSL. `account-manage` owns cron job create, update, delete, and list operations: it stores the account-scoped cron job in DynamoDB and creates, updates, or deletes the matching EventBridge Scheduler schedule. EventBridge Scheduler wakes `harness-processing` with `{ kind: "cron-job", accountId, cronJobId }`, and the harness starts the configured agent asynchronously.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  Manage["account-manage<br/>cron create/update/delete/list"] --> Jobs["DynamoDB: CronJobs"]
  Manage --> Scheduler["EventBridge Scheduler<br/>schedule lifecycle"]
  Scheduler -->|"cron-job event"| Harness["harness-processing"]
  Harness --> Jobs
  Harness -->|"internal async worker event"| Harness
  Harness --> AsyncAgentResult["AsyncAgentResult"]
```

Developers who need custom chaining, cleanup, polling, or external workflow behavior can deploy their own scheduled worker and call the existing direct or async API.

## Channel Webhooks

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  Provider["Provider webhook"] -->|"POST /webhooks/\{accountId\}/\{agentId\}/\{channel\}"| Url["harness-processing URL"]
  Url --> Load["load account + agent config"]
  Load --> Adapter["build channel adapter from agent config"]
  Adapter --> Auth["verify provider-native auth"]
  Auth --> Parse["parse normalized channel message"]
  Parse --> Ack["immediate provider ACK"]
  Parse --> After["afterResponse"]
  After --> Handler["handleChannelRequest()"]
  Handler --> Session["account-scoped session"]
  Session --> Agent["agent loop"]
  Agent --> Reply["channel actions<br/>sendText / typing / reactions"]
  Reply --> Provider
```

Customers talk to the provider bot/app owned by the account. They never receive an account secret.

## WebSocket Gateway (durable NATS JetStream)

Streaming responses are published to a **durable, conversation-scoped JetStream
stream**. The platform owns the durable stream and a documented replay contract;
the gateway that relays to a browser is the **caller's application** (this is a
PaaS — we provide the connection, not the client). Because the stream is keyed by
conversation (not connection), a client that drops can reconnect with a fresh
socket and **replay** events it missed — including a background job's result that
landed after the original connection closed.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  Harness["harness-processing Lambda"] -->|"nc.publish (one publish)"| Subj["subject<br/>v1.acct.agent.ws.response.convToken"]
  Subj -->|"live fan-out"| GWlive["core subscribe<br/>(connected client)"]
  Subj -->|"captured (stored once)"| NATS["WS_RESPONSES stream<br/>(durable buffer)"]
  NATS -->|"JetStream consumer<br/>replay from seq / time"| GWreplay["reconnecting / late client"]
  GWlive -->|"forward tokens"| Client["WebSocket Client"]
  GWreplay -->|"replay missed, then resume live"| Client
```

The gateway (the **caller's** service) owns client auth, the subscription, and
the `nats-worker` Lambda invocation. Lambda does **one core publish** per chunk;
the bound `WS_RESPONSES` stream captures that same message for replay.

NATS subject patterns:

| Subject | Direction | Purpose |
| --------- | ----------- | --------- |
| `v1.{accountId}.{agentId}.ws.response.{convToken}` | Lambda → Gateway | Vercel AI SDK stream events (`step-start`, `text`, `tool-call`, `finish`, `error`, …) |

`convToken = base64url(publicConversationKey)` — a single NATS-safe token.

**One publish, two read paths — and not double storage.** A core publish is
fanned out live to any core subscriber on the subject *and* captured once by the
stream. **Core publish stores nothing itself** — the stream is the only stored
copy, so this is not duplicated storage. The platform exposes both read paths and
lets the application choose how to switch:

- **Connected →** `subscribeConversationLive` (core `subscribe`) — lowest latency.
- **Dropped mid-stream → reconnect & resume:** `readConversationStream`
  (JetStream consumer) from `startSequence` (last `JsMsg.seq`) or `startTime`,
  catch up the missed events, then continue live. This is JetStream's **only**
  job — resuming a turn that is *still streaming*.
- **Reconnect after the turn finished →** there is nothing to resume: the buffer
  was purged at persist time, so read the completed turn from the conversation DB.

Switching policy is the consuming app's call — the platform only guarantees a
monotonic cursor (`JsMsg.seq` for stream readers; the envelope `sequence`/`eventId`
for core subscribers) so a core→stream switch dedupes with a trivial `seq` check.

Notes:

- **Speed:** core publish is fire-and-forget (no per-token PubAck round-trip), a
  shared `TextEncoder`, and the subject precomputed once per publisher — so token
  publishing stays on the fast path.
- **Transport (by URL scheme):** `connectNats` in `nats.ts` selects the client
  from `NATS_URL`: `wss://`/`ws://` → WebSocket (`nats.ws`) for out-of-cluster
  callers like Lambda (the cluster exposes only a `wss://` ingress externally);
  `nats://`/`tls://` → core TCP (`nats`) for in-cluster callers on the internal
  network (lower latency; core `4222` is not exposed externally). Moving a service
  in-cluster is then a `NATS_URL` change, not a code change. `NATS_TOKEN` carries
  the token-auth credential (omit for an unauthenticated server).
- **No duplicates:** a single read path never sees a message twice; each publish
  also carries a `Nats-Msg-Id` (`eventId:sequence`) so the stream's
  `duplicate_window` (~2 min) collapses any publish retry.
- **Storage (kept minimal):** the stream is an **in-flight resume buffer**, not
  the source of truth — the conversation history DB is. So it holds as little as
  possible:
  - **Purge on persist:** when a turn finishes and is saved to the DB, the server
    (`LiveNatsPublisher.purge`, right after the terminal `done`) deletes that
    conversation from the stream — a later reconnect reads the saved turn from the
    DB, so keeping the buffer would be pointless. The detached async continuation
    re-enters the same path, so it purges when *it* finishes.
  - **Short backstop `max_age` (~3 min):** only for turns that never persist
    cleanly (e.g. an error/crash before the purge); they expire instead of piling up.
  - Other knobs in `nats.ts`: `RESPONSE_STREAM_STORAGE` (`File` default; `Memory`
    is faster/cheaper but lost on restart) and `max_msgs_per_subject`. The
    retention knobs are mutable, so `ensureResponseStream` syncs them onto the
    existing stream on update. HA `replicas: 3` multiplies storage by 3.
- `connectionId` is now only a routing/label field on event headers — it no
  longer scopes the subject, so overlapping turns on one conversation share a
  stream (group per turn with `headers.eventId`).
- Background jobs launched over a WebSocket turn publish their result to the same
  conversation stream, so they survive the socket and replay on reconnect.
- `ENABLE_WEBSOCKET=true` and `NATS_URL` are required for `nats-worker`
  invocations (plus `NATS_TOKEN` for a token-auth server). When WebSocket is
  disabled, the direct API stays SSE-only and NATS config is ignored.

> **Infra (lives in the infra repo, applied via CI/CD):** the cluster NATS runs
> JetStream with a **WebSocket listener + Traefik ingress** at `wss://nats.beeblast.co`
> (token auth via the `nats-auth` secret) and a file-backed JetStream PVC — so the
> Lambda connects over `wss://` today. For production durability, enable JetStream
> **clustering** (`replicas: 3`, which multiplies storage by 3). Core `4222` stays
> cluster-internal for future in-cluster callers (see the Transport note above).

## Deferred delivery & resume (background jobs)

A detached sandbox job outlives the Lambda that launched it, so its result has to
be delivered in a *later* invocation and routed back to wherever the turn came
from. The mechanism is a small **delivery descriptor carried on the Session and
persisted with the job**, so no live connection state needs to survive — only an
identifier the next invocation can rebuild from.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  Turn["turn runs (Session.delivery)<br/>channel { name, source } /<br/>nats { connectionId, convKey } /<br/>async (poll)"] -->|"bash background:true"| Row["DynamoDB: AsyncToolResult<br/>{ delivery, completionToken,<br/>conversationKey, parentEventId }"]
  Turn --> Job["detached job in sandbox"]
  Job -->|"on exit: POST /sandbox-jobs/&lt;id&gt;/complete<br/>(x-job-token)"| Settle["settle row"]
  Settle -->|"reinvoke worker<br/>(inject result, continue conversation)"| Resume["agent resumes where it left off"]
  Resume --> Deliver{"delivery.kind"}
  Deliver -->|"channel"| Chan["rebuild adapter from config + source → sendText"]
  Deliver -->|"nats"| Pub["core publish to conversation stream"]
  Deliver -->|"async"| Poll["settle status row / fire hooks.webhook"]
```

- **What's saved, and why it's safe.** `Session.delivery` (an `AsyncToolDelivery`)
  describes the origin: a chat channel (`{channelName, source}` — the routing
  payload only, *never* credentials), a WebSocket conversation, or plain async.
  `bash background:true` copies it onto the `AsyncToolResult` row in DynamoDB
  alongside the per-job `completionToken`. No account secret is stored or enters
  the sandbox; channel credentials are re-fetched (decrypted) from the agent
  config at delivery time.
- **Reinvoke & continue.** When the job POSTs its completion (authenticated by the
  per-job token), the harness settles the row and reuses the existing async-tool
  continuation path: it rebuilds the turn from `parentEventId`/`conversationKey`,
  injects the job result, and runs the agent loop so it **continues where it left
  off**. This is the same settle→continue pipeline used by detached uploaded async
  tools; background jobs add only the `delivery` routing on top.
- **Deliver to origin.** After the loop, the follow-up is pushed to the recorded
  origin: a channel `sendText`, a durable JetStream publish (replayed on
  reconnect), or a status-row settle. See `bash.tool.ts`, `handler.ts`
  (`continueAfterAsyncToolSettlement`, `pushReplyToChannel`), and `integrations.ts`
  (`sendChannelReply`).

## Sandbox & Workspace Boundaries

**Sandbox** (compute) and **workspace** (persistent S3 files) are independent,
account-scoped records, referenced from agent config by id (`sandbox`, `workspaces`). The
handler resolves those references (`resolveAgentRuntime`) before the agent loop. A
sandbox can be attached agent-wide (`config.sandbox`) or per workspace
(`workspaces[].sandbox`, overriding the agent-level one). Each workspace's *effective*
sandbox decides its tools: `read`/`write`/`edit`/`glob`/`grep`/`bash` when present, or
read-only `read`/`glob` when absent (via a read-only mount by default, or direct S3 with the
`sandbox: null` opt-out); `bash` is also exposed stateless when there is no workspace. Each tool's `permissionMode` (`edit`/`ask`/`bypass`)
is resolved per call from the selected workspace.

Every sandbox-backed tool compiles to a single `run` against the provider (`lambda`/`e2b`/
`daytona`/`kubernetes`/`vercel`). The lambda provider deploys the same image as four functions
(workspace mount × network slot) and auto-selects one per run. A workspace's namespace is
derived from `accountId:workspaceId`, so agents that reference the same `workspaceId` share
files — including across the sandbox-backed and read-only S3 paths. A workspace with no
sandbox still serves `MEMORY.md` via the S3 API. `workspace.harness.enabled=false`
suppresses only the MEMORY/TASKS guidance.

```mermaid

```

See [Workspace & Sandbox](workspace/index.md) for the full model.

## Model and Tool Configuration

Agents control model selection, channel credentials, optional skills, subagents, and tool access through encrypted agent config. `harness.ts` resolves `config.model`; `tools/index.ts` exposes the sandbox tools from a referenced `sandbox` (+ `workspaces`), subagent dispatch from `config.subagent`, search/research tools from `config.tools`, and `load_skill` when `config.skills.enabled` is true and `config.skills.allowed` has paths. See the [API Reference](/api-reference) for the complete `AgentConfig` schema.

## Storage Boundaries

- `AccountConfig`: account metadata and account secret hash.
- `AgentConfig`: account-owned encrypted runtime config payloads.
- `SandboxConfig` / `WorkspaceConfig`: account-scoped sandbox and workspace records referenced from agent config by id.
- `AccountTool`: uploaded custom tool records (bundles live in the ToolBundles S3 bucket).
- `CronJobs`: scheduled agent runs managed by `account-manage`.
- `Conversations`: normalized model messages by account-scoped `conversationKey`.
- `ProcessedEvents`: dedup markers and short-lived conversation lease records.
- `AsyncAgentResult`: async direct API and subagent state for `/status/{eventId}` polling.
- `AsyncToolResult`: async tool call state, same-table detached group rows for callback fan-in, delivery metadata for non-SSE continuations, and structured outputs for parent result injection.
- `AccountSignupRateLimit`: TTL rows throttling public account creation per source IP.
- `PersistentSandboxInstance`: reserved sandbox instances for persistent e2b/daytona/vercel providers.
- S3 workspace bucket: workspace files (namespaced by `accountId:workspaceId`) and staged skill bundles.
- S3 skills bucket: account-scoped skill bundles under `<accountId>/<skill-name>`.
- S3 tool-bundles bucket: uploaded custom tool bundles.

On the production stage the config domains (accounts, agents, sandboxes, workspaces, tools, cron jobs) are stored in Convex instead of DynamoDB; runtime tables (conversations, dedup, async results) stay in DynamoDB on every stage.

Built-in tool execution is inline in `harness-processing`. Uploaded custom tools execute in Kubernetes. `async: true` only changes the lifecycle: built-in async stays in the current Lambda, uploaded async waits on SSE, and uploaded async detaches automatically on `/async`, channel, and NATS turns. Subagents are in-process child agent loops; they do not require child Lambda workers.
