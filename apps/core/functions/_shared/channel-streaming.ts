/**
 * Shared channel streaming driver.
 * Turns the agent's streamed output into incremental channel updates so a chat
 * reply appears live instead of only after the whole turn. Three modes:
 *  - "edit": post one placeholder message, then edit it in place on a throttled
 *    cadence (needs the channel's beginMessage/editMessage primitives); when the
 *    reply outgrows the channel's message-length cap the current message is frozen
 *    and streaming continues in a fresh one (rotation).
 *  - "progress": show a status preview of tool activity while the model works, then
 *    swap it for the final answer (also needs the edit primitives).
 *  - "chunk": send a new message as each paragraph completes (uses sendText, so it
 *    works for every channel).
 * Accumulation + throttling live here so each channel adapter stays thin; a channel
 * that cannot edit a posted message falls back to "chunk" for edit/progress modes.
