A serverless, multi-account AI agent harness built on AWS Lambda and Bun. Configure agents, connect them to Telegram, Discord, Slack, GitHub, and more, and run them with your own model keys.

This is the open-source engine behind [BeeBlast](https://github.com/beeblastco). The entire stack is self-hostable — you own your data, your AWS account, and your API keys.

---

## What It Is

- **Serverless agent runtime** — Two Lambda Function URLs handle everything: one for account management, one for streaming agent execution.
- **Multi-tenant** — Each account has its own encrypted config, hashed API secret, and isolated data.
- **Bring your own model** — Google, OpenAI, AWS Bedrock, Vercel AI Gateway, or custom providers via the Vercel AI SDK.
- **Multi-channel** — Telegram, Discord, Slack, GitHub, Facebook Messenger (Pancake), and Zalo webhooks are built in.
- **Extensible** — Skills, subagents, workspaces, sandboxes, cron jobs, async tools, and custom uploaded tools.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone and install
bun install
cp apps/core/.env.example apps/core/.env
# Edit apps/core/.env and set AWS_ACCOUNT_ID, PROJECT_NAME, PROJECT_OWNER_EMAIL

# 2. Set required secrets
cd apps/core
bunx sst secret set AdminAccountSecret <random-value>
bunx sst secret set AccountConfigEncryptionSecret <random-value>

# 3. Deploy
bun run deploy
```

Note the `accountServiceUrl` and `agentServiceUrl` from the deploy output when you deploy locally or on your own cloud. If you're using the BeeBlast hosted version, these are already set for you, then follow the [Getting Started guide](apps/docs/docs/getting-started.md) to create your first account and agent.
