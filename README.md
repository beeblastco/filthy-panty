Experimental serverless multi-account AI chatbot and agent harness on AWS Lambda.

The deployed architecture uses two public Lambda Function URLs:

- `account-manage`: creates accounts, rotates account API secrets, manages account-owned agents and skills, and deletes account-scoped runtime data when an account is deleted.
- `harness-processing`: handles account-authenticated direct API traffic, async work, status polling, and account-scoped Telegram, GitHub, Slack, and Discord webhooks.

The design goal is simple infrastructure for low-volume multi-tenant usage: Bun on Lambda, SST for infra, DynamoDB for account/agent/conversation/status state, S3 for workspace-backed memory/files/tasks and skill bundles, and the Vercel AI SDK for the agent loop. Agents can optionally dispatch subagents that run parallel one-shot tasks and inject results back into the parent conversation.

## Overview

- Runtime: Bun on Lambda `provided.al2023` with ARM64 binaries built by [`scripts/build.ts`](scripts/build.ts).
- Infra: SST v4.
- Model SDK: Vercel AI SDK `ai` with agent-configured Google, OpenAI, Bedrock, and Gateway providers.
- Persistence: DynamoDB + S3.
- Streaming: SSE for sync direct API callers only.
- Agent config: stored in DynamoDB with encrypted config payloads; account API secrets are hashed.
- Public entrypoints: `account-manage` and `harness-processing` Lambda Function URLs.

## Quick Start

```bash
bun install
cp .env.example .env
bunx sst secret set AdminAccountSecret <long-random-value>
bunx sst secret set AccountConfigEncryptionSecret <long-random-value>
bun run check
bun run build
bun run deploy
```

After deploy, create an account through the `accountServiceUrl` output. The response returns an `accountSecret` once. Use that secret as `Authorization: Bearer <accountSecret>` for direct API calls and account self-management.

Create an account, then create an agent with runtime `config`. Direct and async calls include `agentId`. See [Account management](docs/account-management.md#agents) for the supported flow.

## Common Commands

```bash
bun run dev
bun run check
bun run test
bun run build
bun run deploy
```

Discord slash command syncing is still a manual utility:

```bash
bun run discord:sync
```
