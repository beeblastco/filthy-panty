> An open, experimental serverless multi-account AI chatbot and agent harness on AWS Lambda — now a Bun-workspaces monorepo that also hosts the dashboard, the shared Convex backend, the docs site, the CLI/SDK, and demos.

`filthy-panty` is the reference implementation behind [BeeBlast](https://github.com/beeblastco) — a low-overhead, multi-tenant agent platform designed to let small teams ship production-grade AI agents without standing up Kubernetes, queues, or bespoke streaming infrastructure. The core app runs on Bun + AWS Lambda, persists state in DynamoDB and S3, and streams responses via SSE through Lambda Function URLs.

If you want to self-host a multi-agent backend, integrate AI into Telegram/Discord/Slack/GitHub, or learn how to build an agent harness on top of the Vercel AI SDK — this repo is for you.

---

## Features

- **Serverless by default** — two Lambda Function URLs, no API Gateway, no always-on containers.
- **Multi-tenant accounts** — each account has its own encrypted config, hashed API secret, and isolated runtime data.
- **Bring-your-own model** — Google, OpenAI, Bedrock, Vercel AI Gateway, and custom providers configured per account.
- **Multi-channel integrations** — Telegram, Discord, Slack, GitHub, Facebook Messenger (Pancake), and Zalo out of the box.
- **Workspaces & sandboxes** — S3-backed workspace files plus pluggable execution sandboxes (Lambda, E2B, Daytona, Kubernetes, Vercel).
- **Skills system** — account-scoped instruction bundles loaded on demand during a turn.
- **Subagents** — dispatch parallel one-shot child agents and inject their results back into the parent conversation.
- **Streaming-first** — SSE for sync direct API callers and a NATS JetStream path for WebSocket gateways.
- **Async + cron** — long-running requests, status polling, and EventBridge-scheduled jobs.

---

## Architecture

The deployed system exposes two public Lambda Function URLs (plus a testing-only `mock-webhook-subscribe` URL):

- `account-manage` — account creation, secret rotation, and CRUD for account-owned agents, skills, sandboxes, and workspaces.
- `harness-processing` — streams agent responses, runs the model/tool loop, and serves account-scoped channel webhooks.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Choice |
| --- | --- |
| Runtime | Bun on Lambda `provided.al2023` (ARM64 binaries) |
| Infra-as-code | [SST v4](https://sst.dev/) on Pulumi |
| Model SDK | [Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/) (`ai` package) |
| Providers | Google, OpenAI, Bedrock, Vercel AI Gateway, custom |
| Persistence | DynamoDB (config + conversations; the production stage stores config domains in Convex) + S3 (files + skills) |
| Streaming | SSE via Lambda Function URL (`RESPONSE_STREAM` invoke mode); NATS JetStream for WebSocket fan-out |
| Docs | Docusaurus |

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) `>= 1.3`
- An AWS account with credentials configured (`AWS_PROFILE`)
- [SST](https://sst.dev/) — installed automatically via `bun install`

### 1. Clone & install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/beeblastco/filthy-panty.git
cd filthy-panty
bun install
cp apps/core/.env.example apps/core/.env
```

### 2. Set SST secrets

```bash
cd apps/core
bunx sst secret set AdminAccountSecret <long-random-value>
bunx sst secret set AccountConfigEncryptionSecret <long-random-value>
```

### 3. Deploy

```bash
bun run deploy   # from the repo root (fans out to apps/core)
```

Note the two Function URLs from the deploy output (`accountServiceUrl`, `agentServiceUrl`), then follow [`apps/docs/docs/getting-started.md`](apps/docs/docs/getting-started.md) to create your first account and agent.

### Run the demos

The [`demos/`](demos/) directory has runnable scripts for every major feature — streaming, async, tool approval, subagents, skills, sandboxes, multi-workspace setups, and more. Each script creates a temporary account, runs a smoke test, and cleans up. They consume the [`filthy-panty` SDK package](packages/filthy-panty/).

```bash
bun demos/stream.ts        # SSE with tools
bun demos/async.ts         # Async with polling
bun demos/subagent.ts      # Subagent dispatch
bun demos/skills.ts        # Skill CRUD
```

## Contributing

Contributions are very welcome! Whether you want to fix a bug, add a new channel, build a new tool, or improve the docs — open an issue first so we can align on the approach, then send a PR.

### Development workflow

```bash
bun install              # install all workspaces (root only)
bun run check            # typecheck core, convex, SDK, and demos
bun run test             # core unit tests (max-concurrency 1)
bun run build            # build all Lambda binaries
```

CI runs `check`, `test`, and `build` on every PR via [`.github/workflows/ci.yaml`](.github/workflows/ci.yaml). Pushes to `dev` deploy the `dev` stage and pushes to `main` deploy the `production` stage; PR branches never deploy.

### Conventions

- Bun + TypeScript, ESM, no transpile step. Bun workspaces with the isolated linker — declare every dependency a package imports.
- File header comments use a block-docstring style — see [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) for the full style guide.
- Channel-specific logic belongs in `apps/core/functions/_shared/<channel>-channel.ts`; commands belong in `apps/core/functions/_shared/commands.ts`.
- Shared code only goes in `functions/_shared/` when it's actually shared between Lambdas.
- Don't deploy to anyone else's stage — `dev` is the default.

### Reporting issues

- **Bugs / feature requests** — open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/beeblastco/filthy-panty/issues).
- **Security vulnerabilities** — please email the maintainers privately rather than filing a public issue.
