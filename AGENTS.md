# Agent

This repository is a Bun-workspaces monorepo for the agent platform: a serverless AI agent harness on AWS (Lambda + Vercel AI SDK + SST), the Next.js dashboard, the shared Convex backend, the developer docs site, the CLI/SDK package, and runnable demos.

Monorepo layout:

```text
apps/core/          @filthy-panty/core — SST app (Lambdas, scripts, tests). Future Rust port boundary.
apps/dashboard/     @filthy-panty/dashboard — Next.js 16 dashboard (was the cherry-coke repo). Has its own AGENTS.md.
apps/docs/          @filthy-panty/docs — Docusaurus site (React 18, isolated here).
packages/convex/    @filthy-panty/convex — shared Convex backend, functions flat at the package root (convex.json functions: ".").
packages/filthy-panty/  filthy-panty — CLI + SDK npm package (name TBD; plan in apps/docs/docs/plans/beeblast-cli.md).
demos/              @filthy-panty/demos — runnable scripts against the deployed API, importing the SDK.
```

Related repos:

- ../infra: Infrastucture repo for the kubernetes cluster and VM provision.
- ../lambda-sanbdox: Custom Lambda runtime for sandbox to run bash, node and python script, simulate VM machine.
- ../cherry-coke: merged into `apps/dashboard/` (archived).

Workspace rules:

- Run `bun install` at the repo root only. Bun uses the isolated linker: every import a package uses must be declared in that package's `package.json` (no hoisted transitive freeloading).
- Root scripts fan out with `bun run --filter`: `build`/`check`/`test`/`deploy` target `@filthy-panty/core`; `docs`/`docs:build` target `@filthy-panty/docs`. Run `sst` commands from `apps/core/`.
- React versions are intentionally split: docs pins React 18 (Docusaurus), dashboard pins React 19 (Next 16). Never add react to the root package.json.
- The core storage adapter reaches the Convex generated API via `require("@filthy-panty/convex/_generated/api")` on purpose — a typed import would drag every backend source into core's stricter typecheck. Keep it a require().
- `packages/convex/_generated/` is committed. After schema changes run `bun run --filter @filthy-panty/convex codegen` and commit the diff. The dashboard image build re-runs `convex deploy`.
- `apps/dashboard/` has its own AGENTS.md with Next.js/Convex/UI conventions — read it before dashboard work.

Key rules (core SST app — paths relative to `apps/core/`):

- Keep the constants, naming pattern, and tag conventions in `sst.config.ts` aligned with the infra repo.
- Each Lambda function lives in its own folder under `functions/` with a `bootstrap.ts` entry point for the Bun custom runtime.
- Default runtime is Bun on Lambda `provided.al2023` with ARM64 binaries built by `scripts/build.ts`.
- The deployed architecture uses two public Lambdas:
  - `account-manage` — account creation, account secret rotation, and account metadata/config management.
  - `harness-processing` — streaming Function URL (`RESPONSE_STREAM` invoke mode). It accepts account-authenticated direct API requests, async requests, status polling, and supported account-scoped channel webhooks. It normalizes them through `functions/harness-processing/integrations.ts`, runs the agent loop in `functions/harness-processing/harness.ts`, persists conversation state in `functions/harness-processing/session.ts`, and emits SSE only for sync direct API callers.
- The custom Bun runtime used by the deployed path is `startStreamingRuntime` from `functions/_shared/runtime.ts`. It passes the full Lambda Function URL event envelope into the handler so request routing can distinguish direct API traffic from supported webhook traffic and return channel-specific HTTP responses.
- To add a new non-workspace tool: create `functions/harness-processing/tools/<name>.tool.ts`, export a default tool factory, put the tool logic directly inside each tool's `execute`, register that factory in `functions/harness-processing/tools/index.ts`, and add account option validation in `functions/_shared/accounts.ts` only when the tool has account-level options.
- `functions/harness-processing/tools/index.ts` is the static factory registry and account-configured selector used to ensure tool files are bundled into the compiled Lambda binary.
- Custom tools run inline inside `harness-processing` during the streaming request. Do not add queue-based tool execution or external tool-Lambda wiring unless the architecture intentionally changes.
- Sandbox and workspace are independent, account-scoped records (tables `sandboxConfig`/`workspaceConfig`), referenced from agent config by id: `sandbox: "<id>"` + `workspaces: [{name, workspaceId}]`. A referenced sandbox exposes the Claude-Code-style tools (`bash` always; `read`/`write`/`edit`/`glob`/`grep` when a workspace is also attached); approvals follow the sandbox `permissionMode` (`edit`/`ask`/`bypass`). Search/research tools remain opt-in through `config.tools`. CRUD for both lives in `account-manage` (`/accounts/me/{sandboxes,workspaces}`).
- Google Search lives in `functions/harness-processing/tools/google-search.tool.ts` and is enabled through `config.tools.googleSearch`.
- Account provider constructor settings live under `config.provider`. Account model configuration lives under `config.model`: `provider`, `modelId`, normal Vercel AI SDK `streamText` settings, and `options` for `providerOptions`.
- Shared code goes in `functions/_shared/` only when it is actually shared by multiple Lambdas. Keep harness-only code in `functions/harness-processing/`.
- File header comments must use a block-docstring style:

  ```ts
  /**
   * ...
   */

  import ...
  ```

- Leave one blank line between the file header docstring and the first import or code line.
- Keep file header docstrings short. They should describe the file boundary, what belongs there, and where adjacent logic should go. Do not turn them into a function inventory.
- Use `bun run build` to compile all functions, then `bun run deploy` to deploy. Do not deploy except when the user ask to.
- CI/CD runs automatically on push/PR via GitHub Actions. Use `gh run list` and `gh run view` to monitor pipeline status.
- To add a new communication channel (e.g. Slack, WhatsApp): create `functions/_shared/<channel>-channel.ts` implementing the `ChannelAdapter` interface from `functions/_shared/channels.ts`, then wire the normalization path into `functions/harness-processing/integrations.ts`. Reply sending should stay inside that channel's `ChannelActions`; do not hardcode channel-specific logic into shared handlers or the core agent loop.
- To add a new bot command: add an entry to the `commands` array in `functions/_shared/commands.ts` with aliases, description, and an execute function. Commands receive a `CommandContext` with a channel-agnostic `ChannelActions` interface — do not import channel-specific modules from commands.
- Reply formatting uses `markdownToHtml()` from `functions/_shared/telegram.ts` for Telegram. New channels should implement their own formatting in their channel module if needed.
- Core secrets are managed via SST: `AdminAccountSecret` and `AccountConfigEncryptionSecret`. Channel, provider, and tool credentials live in each account's encrypted config when they are account-specific.

Remember:

- The main flow is `incoming request -> integrations.ts -> handler.ts -> session.ts -> harness.ts -> optional channel reply`.
- Keep the Function URL SSE path intact when simplifying code. Do not replace it with synthesized events unless that change is intentional.
- The active persistence layer for harness-processing lives in `functions/harness-processing/session.ts`.
- `functions/harness-processing/handler.ts` should stay thin and orchestration-focused.
- `functions/harness-processing/integrations.ts` owns request normalization and channel/webhook routing.
- `functions/harness-processing/harness.ts` owns the model/tool execution loop.
- Existing custom tools live in `functions/harness-processing/tools/`.
- There is no `phicks` stage for deployment, only `dev`. DO NOT put to `phicks` stage.
- Update docs, examples, and tests file when changes somethings, refactoring something from the original code or added new features. Make sure that when writing the docs, only added in the suitable files, don’t add in every files, avoid writing too much, focus on visualization, diagrams. Remember to update diagrams as well.
- Please check for the interface, some interface can be import directly from the ai-sdk vercel library or other library. Don't over doing this, don't create new interface where we can reuse the interface from the librar. Always double check when you want to create new interface or new types.
- Don't over engineering new features or patch fixes. Keep it simple and keep it elegant. Keep the code readable and easy to visible, easy to navigate. Don't put too much abstraction and functions if it is not necessary.

This project uses [Convex](https://convex.dev) as its backend.

When working on Convex code, **always read
`packages/convex/_generated/ai/guidelines.md` first** for important guidelines on
how to correctly use Convex APIs and patterns. The file contains rules that
override what you may have learned about Convex from training data.

Convex agent skills for common tasks can be installed by running
`npx convex ai-files install`.
