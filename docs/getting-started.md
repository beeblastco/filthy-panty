# Getting Started

Choose your path to get up and running:

- **Managed service** — create an account and start interacting with agents immediately. No deployment required.
- **Self-deployed** — deploy the full serverless infrastructure to your own AWS account for complete control.

Both paths converge on the same account and agent APIs. After setup, you can configure agents, enable tools, connect channels, and integrate via the direct API or messaging platforms.

---

## Path 1: Managed Service

Skip infrastructure. Create an account and start using the platform right away.

### 1. Create an Account

Send a POST request to the managed account service:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://<managed-account-service-url>/accounts" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "username": "my-first-account",
    "description": "My first account"
  }'
```

The response includes your `accountId` and a one-time `secret`:

```json
{
  "account": {
    "accountId": "acct_...",
    "username": "my-first-account",
    "description": "My first account"
  },
  "secret": "fp_acct_..."
}
```

**Store `secret` securely** — it is not recoverable. If lost, rotate it to get a new one.

### 2. Start Building

You now have everything you need. Skip to [Start Building](#start-building) below to create your first agent and send requests.

---

## Path 2: Self-Deployed

Deploy the full infrastructure to your own AWS account.

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed
- An AWS account with CLI access configured
- [SST](https://sst.dev/) installed (`npm install -g sst`)

### 1. Deploy the Infrastructure

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
cp .env.example .env
```

Set the two required SST secrets:

```bash
bunx sst secret set AdminAccountSecret <long-random-value>
bunx sst secret set AccountConfigEncryptionSecret <long-random-value>
```

Build and deploy:

```bash
bun run deploy
```

After deploy, note the two Function URLs from the output:

- `accountServiceUrl` — for account and agent management
- `agentServiceUrl` — for sending requests to agents

Set them as environment variables:

```bash
export ACCOUNT_SERVICE_URL=<accountServiceUrl>
export AGENT_SERVICE_URL=<agentServiceUrl>
```

### 2. Create an Account

Create your first account on your own deployment:

```bash
curl -X POST "$ACCOUNT_SERVICE_URL/accounts" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "username": "my-first-account",
    "description": "My first account"
  }'
```

Save the returned `secret`:

```bash
export ACCOUNT_SECRET=fp_acct_...
```

### 3. Start Building

You now own the infrastructure. Skip to [Start Building](#start-building) below to create your first agent and send requests.

---

## Start Building

This section is the same regardless of which path you chose. You need `ACCOUNT_SERVICE_URL`, `AGENT_SERVICE_URL`, and `ACCOUNT_SECRET` set.

### Create an Agent

Agents hold the model, provider, and tool configuration. Create one with your account secret:

```bash
curl -X POST "$ACCOUNT_SERVICE_URL/accounts/me/agents" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCOUNT_SECRET" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "assistant",
    "description": "A general-purpose assistant",
    "config": {
      "provider": {
        "google": { "apiKey": "YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY" }
      },
      "model": {
        "provider": "google",
        "modelId": "gemini-3-flash"
      },
      "agent": {
        "system": "You are a helpful assistant."
      }
    }
  }'
```

The response includes your `agentId`:

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "accountId": "acct_...",
    "agentId": "agent_...",
    "name": "assistant",
    "description": "A general-purpose assistant"
  }
}
```

Save it:

```bash
export AGENT_ID=agent_...
```

#### Supported Providers

| Provider | Config key | Required fields |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Google | `google` | `apiKey` |
| OpenAI | `openai` | `apiKey` |
| Bedrock | `bedrock` | `region`, `apiKey` or AWS credentials |
| Gateway | `gateway` | `apiKey` |
| MiniMax | `minimax` | `apiKey` |

### Send Your First Request

#### Sync SSE Request

POST to the agent service. The response streams as SSE:

```bash
curl -X POST "$AGENT_SERVICE_URL" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCOUNT_SECRET" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "agentId": "'"$AGENT_ID"'",
    "eventId": "req-001",
    "conversationKey": "my-first-conversation",
    "events": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
          { "type": "text", "text": "Hello, who are you?" }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }'
```

The SSE stream includes raw Vercel AI SDK events (`text`, `tool-call`, `tool-result`, `finish`). When the agent finishes:

```bash
event: finish
data: {"type":"finish","finishReason":"stop"}

event: done
data: {}
```

#### Async Request

For long-running requests, use the async endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST "$AGENT_SERVICE_URL/async" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCOUNT_SECRET" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "agentId": "'"$AGENT_ID"'",
    "eventId": "req-002",
    "conversationKey": "my-first-conversation",
    "events": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
          { "type": "text", "text": "Tell me a long story." }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }'
```

The response includes a `statusUrl` for polling:

```json
{
  "statusUrl": "https://.../status/req-002?agentId=agent_..."
}
```

Poll the status endpoint:

```bash
curl "$AGENT_SERVICE_URL/status/req-002?agentId=$AGENT_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCOUNT_SECRET"
```

Status responses:

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `processing` | Agent is working |
| `completed` | Finished — includes the response |
| `failed` | Error occurred |
| `awaiting_approval` | Tool approval needed |

### Enable Tools (Optional)

Add tools to your agent config:

```bash
curl -X PATCH "$ACCOUNT_SERVICE_URL/accounts/me/agents/$AGENT_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCOUNT_SECRET" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "config": {
      "tools": {
        "googleSearch": { "enabled": true },
        "tavilySearch": {
          "enabled": true,
          "apiKey": "YOUR_TAVILY_API_KEY"
        }
      }
    }
  }'
```

Available tools: `tavilySearch`, `tavilyExtract`, `googleSearch`.

### Set Up a Channel (Optional)

Connect a messaging platform so users can interact with your agent through Telegram, Discord, Slack, GitHub, Facebook Messenger (via Pancake), or Zalo.

#### Example: Telegram

1. Create a bot via [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and get the `botToken`.
2. Generate a random `webhookSecret` for webhook verification.
3. Update your agent config:

```bash
curl -X PATCH "$ACCOUNT_SERVICE_URL/accounts/me/agents/$AGENT_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCOUNT_SECRET" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "config": {
      "channels": {
        "telegram": {
          "botToken": "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN",
          "webhookSecret": "YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET",
          "allowedChatIds": [123456789]
        }
      }
    }
  }'
```

4. Set the webhook URL in Telegram:

```bash
curl "https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/setWebhook" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "url": "'"$AGENT_SERVICE_URL"'/webhooks/<ACCOUNT_ID>/<AGENT_ID>/telegram",
    "secret_token": "YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET"
  }'
```

Users can now message your bot on Telegram and get responses from your agent.

#### Other Channels

| Channel | Required config |
| --- | --- |
| Discord | `botToken`, `publicKey` |
| Slack | `botToken`, `signingSecret` |
| GitHub | `webhookSecret`, `appId`, `privateKey` |
| Pancake | `pageId`, `pageAccessToken` |
| Zalo | `botToken`, `webhookSecret`, `allowedUserIds` |

See [Channels](channels/index.md) for full setup details.

### Run Example Scripts

The repository includes example scripts to probe a live deployment:

```bash
export AGENT_SERVICE_URL=<your-agent-service-url>
export ACCOUNT_SERVICE_URL=<your-account-service-url>
export ACCOUNT_GOOGLE_API_KEY=<your-google-api-key>
export ACCOUNT_TAVILY_API_KEY=<your-tavily-api-key>

bun examples/stream.ts        # SSE with tools
bun examples/async.ts         # Async with polling
bun examples/tool-approval.ts # Tool approval flow
bun examples/subagent.ts      # Subagent dispatch
bun examples/skills.ts        # Skill CRUD
bun examples/invoke-skill.ts  # Skill loading during a streamed turn
```

Each script creates a temporary account, runs the test, and cleans up.

### Define Your Own Agent Config

The agent config is a JSON object that controls everything about how your agent runs. See [`examples/account.config.example.json`](../examples/account.config.example.json) for a full working example, or reference the [API Reference](/api-reference) for the complete `AgentConfig` schema.

Key config sections:

- `provider` — AI SDK provider constructor settings (Google, OpenAI, Bedrock, Gateway, MiniMax)
- `model` — `streamText` parameters: model ID, temperature, structured output, provider options
- `agent` — max turns and system prompt
- `tools` — external tools like Tavily and Google Search
- `workspace` — memory, filesystem, and tasks
- `skills` — account-scoped skill bundles
- `subagent` — parallel subagent dispatch
- `channels` — Telegram, Discord, Slack, GitHub, Pancake
- `hooks` — lifecycle webhook events
- `session` — history pruning and compaction
